# Low-Level I/O Procedures

## Description
The .asm file implements two primary I/O procedures:
1. *ReadVal* invokes a *getString* macro to get a string of digits from the user, and converts the string to its numeric representation while validating it.

2. *WriteVal* converts a numeric value to its string representation, and invokes a *displayString* macro to display the string.

The program gets 10 signed integers from the user, stores them in an array, and then displays the values, sum and arithmetic mean of the array contents.
