# Low-Level I/O Procedures

## Description
The .asm file implements two primary I/O procedures:
1. *ReadVal* invokes a *getString* macro to get a string of digits from the user, and converts the string to its numeric representation while validating it.

2. *WriteVal* converts a numeric value to its string representation, and invokes a *displayString* macro to display the string.

The program gets 10 signed integers from the user, stores them in an array, and then displays the values, sum and arithmetic mean of the array contents.

## Installation
1. Install [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).

2. When asked to select your intended workload, select "Desktop development with C++."

3. Configure the necessary libraries. **Note**: If you are using an older version of Visual Studio (prior to 2019), other versions of
the textbook libraries are available from the following website: http://asmirvine.com/
   
   1. Download a zip file containing the libraries:\
   http://asmirvine.com/gettingStartedVS2019/Irvine.zip.
   
   2. Extract the contents of this file into the C:\ directory. If the files were extracted properly, the following file should
   exist on your computer: C:\Irvine\Irvine32.lib
   
   3. Download a zip file containing a 32-bit Visual Studio 2019 project:
   http://asmirvine.com/gettingStartedVS2019/Project32_VS2019.zip
   
   4. Extract the contents of this file into a directory (e.g. C:\CS271). If the extraction was successful you should be able to locate
   the file: C:\CS271\Project32_VS2019\AddTwo.asm.
